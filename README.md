English Description: This project uses basic input/output commands to receive data from the user and, based on this input, draws various regular polygons using the Turtle library. 
Various mathematical calculations are used to proportionally determine the side length and turning angle, ensuring the drawing fits aesthetically on the screen. 
This project is also a fun and tangible way to demonstrate that as the number of sides increases, the polygon approaches the shape of a circle. 
The primary purpose is to visually explain and concretize the abstract concept that a circle is a polygon with infinite sides, making it particularly useful for educational purposes, especially for children.

How to Run (Nasıl Çalıştırılır): Save the code as turtle_gen_draw.py. Open your terminal or command prompt. Execute the script: python turtle_gen_draw.py. Enter the desired number of sides (Li
